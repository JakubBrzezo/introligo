  title: "Diagram Examples Documentation"
  description: "Examples of using different diagram types with Introligo"
  overview: |
    This documentation demonstrates how to include various types of diagrams in your
    Sphinx documentation using Introligo. Supported diagram formats include:

    - **PlantUML** - For UML diagrams (sequence, class, activity, etc.)
    - **Mermaid** - For flowcharts, sequence diagrams, and more
    - **Graphviz** - For directed graphs and architecture diagrams
    - **SVG** - For static vector graphics

  inline_diagrams:
    title: "Inline Diagram Examples"
    description: "Examples of diagrams defined inline in the configuration"
    overview: |
      You can also define diagrams inline in your YAML configuration using the
      `content` field instead of `diagram_includes`. This is useful for simple diagrams.
