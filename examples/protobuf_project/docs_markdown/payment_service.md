# Payment Service

The Payment Service handles payment processing with support for multiple payment methods. It demonstrates the protobuf `oneof` pattern for polymorphic data structures.

## Supported Payment Methods

The service supports diverse payment options through a polymorphic `PaymentMethod` message:

- **Credit/Debit Cards** - Tokenized card payments with AVS verification
- **Bank Accounts** - ACH transfers for checking and savings accounts
- **Digital Wallets** - PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay, Amazon Pay, Venmo
- **Cryptocurrency** - Bitcoin, Ethereum, and major stablecoins
- **Buy Now Pay Later** - Affirm, Klarna, Afterpay, Sezzle

## Security

All sensitive payment data uses tokenization:
- Card numbers are never stored directly
- Tokens are generated by payment processors
- PCI DSS compliance through token-based architecture

## Payment Flow

1. **Create Payment** - Initiate payment for an order
2. **Authentication** - 3D Secure for supported cards
3. **Processing** - Payment gateway processes the transaction
4. **Completion** - Funds captured and order confirmed
5. **Refund** (if needed) - Full or partial refund support
